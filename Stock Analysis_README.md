Buying and selling of stocks (or bonds and other securities) is a potentially profitable business, but can also lead to big finanancial losses. Business Analytics can provide insights to better inform choices in this industry.
When designing a stock portfolio, some of the decisions to take are:
 The capital to invest;
 The risk the investor is willing to take;
 The time the investor will wait for his/her returns.
The use of analytics methods can help with some of these decisions.

The task was to write a computer program, which allows users to consult/analyse/model stock times-series. It should source its data online, but optimise its use of downloaded data, to avoid excessive network traffic.

Users have the possibility of searching for specific stocks, and query specified time ranges, along with associated analysis, such as statistical descriptions of prices and/or volume (mean, median, range, etc), technical indicators, visualisation (of the raw data, but also of transformations, such as moving averages), and even basic modelling (such as regression).

Data is restricted to daily frequency.
